    <string name="wallet_description">BringYour uses a USDC stablecoin self-custody wallet provided by <a href="https://circle.com">Circle</a>. BringYour can query the balance of the wallet but cannot move any funds out of the wallet. However you, as the owner, can transfer funds out to an exchange or another wallet at any time. Money earned by providing services to the network (in the provide tab) are transferred into your wallet as USDC. We use the Polygon blockchain to minimize transfer fees and maximize compatibility with exchanges.</string>

    <string name="wallet_transfer_out_description">Your wallet is on the Polygon blockchain. The transfer to address must be on the Polygon blockchain. If you are depositing to an exchange, make sure you select your Polygon USDC wallet address. It is recommended to send a small test amount at first, and then send the rest after confirming the receipt of the test amount.</string>
    <string name="wallet_transfer_out_terms">I understand this is my wallet and BringYour cannot help recover lost funds.</string>
