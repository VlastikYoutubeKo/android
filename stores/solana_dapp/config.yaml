      new_in_version: |
        This is a big one! We spent the last month fixing issues and bringing payment contracts back to the network. This release includes:
        - Fixes to the client to connect to providers faster and more reliably.
        - Fixes to the provider to keep the provider running in the background when enabled.
        - Fixes to the VPN to allow users to completely turn off the VPN.
        - Enable payment contracts. After April 15, contracts will be required between non-network/friends and family.
